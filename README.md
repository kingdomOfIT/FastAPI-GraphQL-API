## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Project leverages the power of FastAPI, Docker, and GraphQL to create a high-performance backend infrastructure. FastAPI provides lightning-fast asynchronous support, while Docker ensures easy deployment and scalability across diverse environments. With GraphQL, we offer a flexible and efficient data querying interface, empowering developers to fetch precisely the data they need, optimizing network usage. This project aims to streamline development workflows, enhance application performance, and facilitate seamless integration with modern frontend frameworks.

## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **High-Performance Backend Infrastructure**: Utilize FastAPI, Docker, and GraphQL to create a backend with exceptional speed and scalability, ensuring optimal performance for your applications.

👉 **Efficient Data Management with PostgreSQL**: Leverage a PostgreSQL database within Docker, providing a reliable and efficient storage solution for your application's data.

👉 **User and Phone Number Models**: Define two models for users and phone numbers, establishing a structured data schema for managing user information and contact details.

👉 **CRUD Operations**: Implement mutations for creating, updating, and deleting user records, offering robust functionality for managing user data within the system.

👉 **Flexible Data Queries with GraphQL**: Utilize GraphQL queries to retrieve lists of users and individual user details, facilitating dynamic and efficient data fetching tailored to specific requirements.

👉 **Relationships Between User and Phone Number**: Establish a relationship between the user and phone number models, enabling seamless retrieval of associated phone numbers when querying user data, enhancing data coherence and accessibility.

👉 **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Develop a suite of tests to rigorously validate GraphQL queries and mutations, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data retrieval and manipulation functionalities across various scenarios and edge cases.
